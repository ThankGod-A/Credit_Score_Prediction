#### Credit_Score_Prediction
-----------------------------

Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to determine the creditworthiness of a person or a small, owner-operated business. Lenders use credit scoring to help decide whether to extend or deny credit.

### About Dataset

Utiva Schools provided the dataset, and it contains 709 train instances and 293 test instances. Each row in the dataset represents an HMDA-reported loan application, and the dataset we are working with covers one particular year.

The dataset consists of a train and test dataset in CSV format. The train dataset has 24 columns and 709 rows while the test dataset contains 23 columns and 293 rows. The datasets contain records like ‘months_loan_duration’, credit_history, purpose, amount, saving_balance, employement_length, existing_credit, default, purpose, installment_rate, property, etc.

This analysis aims to determine if a person has credibility, i.e, credit_worthy to be given a loan and to help decide whether to extend or deny credit. The aim was achieved by creating a model that predicts (the target variable) the creditworthiness using the binary 0 for default and 1 for payment.

The target variable is labeled default.
